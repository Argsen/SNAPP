                            <b>Average clustering: </b> the clustering coefficient of an individual node is equal to the proportion of possible
                            triangle through that node that actually exist (where a triangle is defined by three mutually linked nodes). Human
                            social networks demonstrate high clustering since, as a rule, one's friends are more likely to be friends with each
                            other than with randomly chosen person.

                            quite low density because of practical limits on the number of people any one person can know or befriend.

                <b>Degree Centrality:</b> simply the number of connections possessed by each node. Analogous to a person's raw popularity
                in a human social network.

                <b>Closeness Centrality:</b> distance between nodes is defined by the shortest path between them (in terms of number
                of discrete links). The closeness centrality of a node is equal to 1/(sum of distances to all other nodes).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Betweenness Centrality:</b> is equal to the proportion of all shortest paths between nodes that pass through a particular
                node. Can be a valuable property in human social networks because people can leverage their connection to different
                groups a variety of ways.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Eigenvector Centrality:</b> is a bit more complicated to compute (see link above), but is based on the intuition
                that an central node is one that is connected to other central nodes. Closely related to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">
                    algorithms</a> used by Google and others to sort search results. This measure may not work for very small networks,
                so try building up a reasonably sized network before clicking this button.
